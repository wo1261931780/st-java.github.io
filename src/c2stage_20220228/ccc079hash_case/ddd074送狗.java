    // 实在忍不住了出来说一下，今天把狗送走了，
    // 3.15出生，5.25接回家，最后到今天10.7送到流浪猫狗基地
    // 我是个废物，没有能力养狗，也不能让他自由快乐地四处奔跑，更不能提供一个稳定强大的庇护所
    // 把狗送到基地以后，监控拍到了我，这样应该也就会发现我的狗，不至于让它这两天挨饿受冻
    // 我的人生真是失败，但即使这么失败的人生，也希望它能安度一个成年，稳定活到寿终正寝
    // 今天决定了送狗出去，也决定了不再恋爱，
    // 人在落难时所作的决定，日后身在高处也会记得
    // -------------------------------------------------------
    // I can't help but say that I gave the dog away today.
    // He was born on 3.15, picked up on 5.25 and finally taken to the stray dog base on 10.7 today
    // I'm a loser, I can't afford to keep a dog, nor can I let him run around freely and happily, let alone provide a stable and strong shelter
    // After I took the dog to the base, the CCTV caught me so that my dog would have been found and not left to starve and freeze for the past two days
    // My life has been a failure, but even with that failure, I hope that he will live a stable adult life until the end of his life.
    // I decided today to give the dog away and to stop falling in love.
    // The decisions you make when you're down, you'll remember when you're up...
